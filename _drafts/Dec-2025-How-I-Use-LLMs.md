Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an essential part of my daily workflow. Here's how I use them and which ones I reach for different tasks.

## Coding & Development

### [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)

I use GitHub Copilot with Claude for code development and reviewing PRs. This is the approved tool at work so it is the only option for any internal or closed source projects.

### [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code)

For developing code and for quickly understanding existing open source codebases. I find this much more powerful than Copilot but as it is not an approved tool at work, I limit its use to personal projects and when working on open source code.

## Productivity & Work

### [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/)

I use this for summarizing email threads and documents. It can be helpful for proofreading documents, creating templates and critiquing my drafts.

## Research & General Use

### [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app)

I use this as a general LLM and for research. Comparing it to Claude and ChatGPT, I find its deep research ability better, or at least closer to what I am looking for.

### [Anthropic Claude](https://claude.ai/new)

This is my go-to general LLM and particularly for technical topics and code related general queries.

### [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)

I use this as a general LLM for various tasks.
