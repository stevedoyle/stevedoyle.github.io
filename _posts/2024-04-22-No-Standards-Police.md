# There Are No Standards Police

A [nice piece from Mark Nottingham](https://www.mnot.net/blog/2024/03/13/voluntary) highlighting that contrary to many people's expectations, there are no standards police, especially in standards bodies like the IETF. In fact this lack of standards police makes the adoption of standards, or portions of standard, purely voluntary. And this voluntary aspect speaks loudly to the success or failure of a "standard".
