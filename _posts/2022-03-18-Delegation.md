Delegation is an important component of leadership and management and even productivity flows. For example, the [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) approach to action processing is Do, _Delegate_ or Defer and the [Inbox Zero](http://www.43folders.com/izero) approach for email processing also features delegation as a key step. But effective delegation is more than just handing off a task to someone. The nature of the task and the skills and competencies of the person it is being delegated to need to be carefully considered and the appropriate [delegation level](https://www.managementcentre.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Levels-of-Authority.png) used. [Radical Delegation](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1401598910792011776?s=20&t=lSQ90EsfpZROdZ2VsLWPhA) promotes delegating everything that is not "leveraging" and even for leveraging tasks, it promotes that you should only hold onto those tasks that can only be done by you. But even [Radical Delegation](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1401598910792011776?s=20&t=lSQ90EsfpZROdZ2VsLWPhA) is not blind delegation and instead describes various levels of delegation monitoring, based on the task type, that are closely aligned to the [delegation levels of authority.](https://www.managementcentre.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Levels-of-Authority.png)

A delegation contract helps to set mutual expectations between the delegator and the delegatee about the [level of authority.](https://www.managementcentre.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Levels-of-Authority.png) associated with the delegated task.
