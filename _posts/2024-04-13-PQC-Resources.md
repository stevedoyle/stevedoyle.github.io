- [Open Quantum Safe (OQS)](https://openquantumsafe.org) which maintains [liboqs](https://openquantumsafe.org/liboqs/) ([liboqs on Github](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs))
- The [PKI Consortium](https://pkic.org) maintain a [PQC Capabilities Matrix (PQCCM)](https://pkic.org/pqccm/) that lists software applications, libraries and hardware that includes support for Post Quantum Cryptography.
- [NVIDIA cuPQC](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuPQC) leverages the parallel processing power of NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate post-quantum cryptographic operations.
- [The Rustls TLS Library PQC Key Exchange Support](https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/pq-key-exchange/). The support is currently available via a separate experimental crate, [rustls=post-quantum](https://crates.io/crates/rustls-post-quantum).
