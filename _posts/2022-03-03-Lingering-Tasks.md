Don't you just hate those tasks that clog the arteries of your todo list? They lurk like a bad smell and never seem to get resolved until eventually you realise that they are no longer relevant and can then be deleted with a sigh of relief.

Why do they linger? And what can I do about them?

- Is it still relevant? No: Delete it.
- Is it neither urgent or important? Yes: Delete it?
- Is it poorly defined? Yes: Edit it. Possibly break it into smaller, better defined tasks.
- Is it hard to start? Yes: Break it into smaller more manageable steps.
- Can it be delegated? Yes: Delegate it.
- Sometimes, you just need to prioritise it, schedule it, avoid distractions and get it done!
