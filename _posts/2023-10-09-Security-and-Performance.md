title: "Don't Trade Security for Performance"
---

"Let’s stop thinking that we can trade off security against performance. Yes you can get a higher message rate on that gRPC channel if you don’t use a secure channel. But it’s connecting nodes over an open network. If it’s slow, you can scale performance by adding additional cores or nodes. If it’s not secure, it’s unusable."

I've had this conversation too many times!
