title: "Dec 2023 - What Tools Am I Using?"
---

Given the time of year, here is an updated catalog of the tools that I currently use.

- [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) for capturing notes, journaling, info gathering, task lists and general [PKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for developing code, and a lightweight interface to git.
- [GitHub](https://github.com) for version control.
- Microsoft Teams for chats, meetings and team collaboration at work.
- [Draw.io](https://draw.io), [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) and [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org) for diagrams. I rarely use Visio now and much prefer generating diagrams from text input.
- [PlantUML]((https://plantuml.com) and [Freeplane](https://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Home) for mindmaps.
- [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) for task workflow.
- [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) for workflow and information organisation.
- Altassian Confluence wiki and GitHub/markdown for spec writing at work.
- IPython as a calculator and for simple throwaway scripting.
- Experimenting with [Warp](https://www.warp.dev) as a new terminal.
- [Putty](https://www.putty.org), [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for remote SSH sessions to lab machines and cloud compute instances.
