Rust is an awesome language. But it takes time to learn and even more time to be productive. Some tips.

- Don't fight the borrow checker. Embrace it!
- Read the [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
- Solve the [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises.
- Write some small programs and libraries.
- Use crates instead of reinventing the wheel.
- Read about [Rust design patterms and idioms](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/intro.html) and then rewrite the programs that you wrote earlier.
- Read the [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) again.
