title: "Generalists and Specialists"
---

[Paul Graham's](http://paulgraham.com/) essay on [Is It Worth Being Wise?](http://paulgraham.com/wisdom.html) describes the difference between being "wise" and being "intelligent" (or "smart").

> A wise person knows what to do in most situations, while a smart person knows what to do in situations where few others could.

Thinking about the tech industry, there is a strong parallel between [Generalists and Specialists](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Generalist-vs-specialist-Whats-the-difference#:~:text=However%2C%20most%20career%20paths%20are,the%20distinction%20between%20the%20two.). Generalists have a broad range of skills and while their knowledge might not run deep in any one specific area, they can quickly adapt to changing situations. Specialists tend to possess stronger and sustained interests and are hrpeyspecialized in one area. They are dedicated to problem solving and considered subject matter experts in their fields.

When building a team, the context for the team is important when selecting generalists or specialists as team members. If the team is being put together to solve a specific problem, then the team should be weighted towards specialists. If the team is being put together to tackle multiple projects or areas then the team should be weighted towards generalists.

Tech workers should consider which category they are best suited to. Each category has its pros and cons and a different path, just like the different paths to wisdom and intelligence in Paul Graham's essay. Becoming a generalist requires discipline, working on many different projects to build the broad range of skills. Becoming a specialist requires curiosity and self-indulgence to fully explore an area and to become an expert in that area.

In today's world of AI/ML, Cyber Security and Cloud computing, the demand for specialists are greater than ever, but at the same time generalists are needed to glue things together and keep the lights on!
