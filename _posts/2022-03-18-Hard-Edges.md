Hard edges can mean many things, but from a productivity and workflow perspective, the concept of hard edges can be used to mean clear and defined boundaries between tasks, activities and contexts. This is a core guideline of [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/).

When thinking about templates, there is nothing more confusing that trying to fill in a template and having two sections that mean something very similar and it's not clear how to fill in each section correctly. Different people will interpret them differently and the template will lose its focus and cohesion. By ensuring that there are hard edges between template sections, it reduces the [friction](https://slog.ie/friction/) in using the template.

Similarly, when storing information in a folder structure, too many overlapping folder categories makes it difficult to decide were to store an item that falls in the overlapping space. This is another example of [friction](https://slog.ie/friction/) due to the lack of hard edges. Fewer folder categories with hard edges between them reduces this friction.
