Most people settle for gzip/zstd not because they’re ideal — but because truly custom compression has always been too painful to build, maintain, and deploy.

[OpenZL][1] changes that equation. [Published][4] by Meta and now [open-source][2], it gives you a clean way to build format-aware, specialized lossless compressors. Its killer feature is a universal decoder and self-describing format: you can ship new compressors without changing clients. That alone makes it production-viable in a way prior “research-y” compressors never were.

As illustrated in the [Quick Start Guide][3], it achieves this via a graph model of compression — not a monolithic algorithm. You compose small reversible transforms (“codecs”), train profiles on real samples, and deploy. Generic compressors like zstd guess; OpenZL actually knows your data.

The payoff? On real telemetry & numeric array data, OpenZL reports better compression ratio and better speed than state-of-the-art generic tools. And that’s before you even train a custom profile.

Why does this matter?

- Unlocks performance previously available only via expensive in-house bespoke compressors
- Universal decoder = sane operational story (zero reader churn)
- Open-source, tooling is already usable right now (zli train, zli compress, etc.)

This is the first time “tailored compressor per data format” genuinely looks like standard practice, not an exotic academic experiment.

I expect OpenZL to become the norm for:

- High-volume telemetry / sensor / AI intermediary data
- Anywhere data is homogeneous across millions/billions of objects
- Teams treating compression as infra, not an afterthought

As OpenZL gets widely adopted, I expect generic compressors to become the fallback and OpenZL-trained profiles to become the default for serious workloads.

OpenZL isn’t for everything yet — but it’s the clearest glimpse of what compression will look like five years from now.
