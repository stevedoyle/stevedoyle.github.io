A few months ago, I was in a meeting that should have taken 10 minutes. In fact, it didn't even need a meeting, the decision could have been made offline by the decision owner based on the briefing document.

One team needed to make a simple product decision. But instead of deciding, they invited… everyone. Engineering managers, product managers, design leads — half the org.

Why?
Because nobody wanted to be the one who made the “wrong” call.

So we spent an hour circling the same arguments.
Everyone added input.
Nobody took ownership.
And the meeting ended with the classic corporate non-decision:

“Let’s meet again next week.”

That’s when it hit me:

We weren’t collaborating. We were hiding.

Collaboration had become a shield - a way to spread risk, dilute accountability, and avoid sticking your neck out.

And it wasn’t just this meeting. I started seeing the pattern everywhere:

Managers fighting for “ownership” not because the work mattered, but because status did.

Endless alignment loops because committing felt scarier than delaying.

We like to pretend collaboration is always productive.
But sometimes collaboration is just fear in disguise.

Fear of being wrong.
Fear of stepping on toes.
Fear of losing influence or control.

And ironically, the fear slows everything down.

The teams that move fast do something different:

✔ They name a clear owner early
✔ They keep decision groups small
✔ They treat input as input—not group veto
✔ They accept that a fast, imperfect decision beats a slow, “safe” one
✔ They take accountability instead of hiding behind consensus

Collaboration is valuable.
But collaboration as a risk-avoidance strategy is execution poison.

If you want speed, clarity, and momentum?
You need fewer people in the room—
and more people willing to make the call.
