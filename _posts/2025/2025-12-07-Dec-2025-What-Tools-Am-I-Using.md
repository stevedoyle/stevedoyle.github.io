An updated list of the software and tools that I currently use. My last list was put together in [Dec 2023]({% post_url 2023/2023-12-30-Dec-2023-What-Tools-Am-I-Using %}).

## New This Year

- [LLMs](#llms-new)
- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) for simplifying interaction with git repos.
- [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/) as an in terminal workspace for working on development servers. This is a replacement for Tmux. I find that it is more feature rich and easier to use.

## Dropped This Year

- [Warp](https://www.warp.dev) as a terminal. I found that I was using this less and less in favor of ITerm2. With the availability of Claude Code running in the terminal, I wasn't getting much benefit from Warp so I stopped using it.
- [Putty](https://www.putty.org) and KiTTY for terminal emulation and managing SSH connections from Windows. These were replaced with the Windows Terminal which had built-in SSH support.

## Note-Taking & Knowledge Management

- [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) for capturing notes, journaling, info gathering, task lists and general [PKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management).

## Development & Coding

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for developing code, and a lightweight interface to git.
- [GitHub](https://github.com) for version control.
- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) for simplifying interaction with git repos.

## Communication & Collaboration

- Microsoft Teams for chats, meetings and team collaboration at work.

## Diagramming & Visualization

- [Draw.io](https://draw.io), [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) and [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org) for diagrams.
- [Freeplane](https://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Home) for mindmaps.

## Productivity & Organization

- [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) for task workflow.
- [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) for workflow and information organisation.

## Documentation & Writing

- Atlassian Confluence wiki and GitHub/markdown for spec writing at work.
- Microsoft Word for brief documents and one-pagers. I've never been a fan of using Microsoft Word but it is used heavily by my management chain for shared documents.

## Command Line & Scripting

- IPython as a calculator and for simple throwaway scripting.

## Remote Access

- Windows Terminal and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for remote SSH sessions to lab machines and cloud compute instances.

## LLMs (New)

- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) using Claude for code development and reviewing PRs. This is the approved tool at work so it is the only option for any internal or closed source projects.
- [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) for summarizing email threads and documents. It can be helpful for proofreading documents.
- [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) for developing code and for quickly understanding existing open source codebases. I find this much more powerful than Copilot but as it is not an approved tool at work, I limit its use to personal projects and when working on open source code.
- [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) as a general LLM and for research. Comparing it to Claude and ChatGPT, I find its deep research ability better, or at least closer to what I am looking for.
- [Anthropic Claude](https://claude.ai/new) as a general LLM and particularly for technical topics and code related general queries.
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) as a general LLM.
