Interruptions are the bane of my professional life. As described my Cal Newport in [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/), the highest value work requires periods of intense, distraction free, concentration. The modern workplace is a chaotic environment where open plan offices are designed to foster collaboration and to remove communication barriers between team members. Even the remote office carries the expectation of being highly contactable to maintain the collaboration. There is a tension here between producing high value work and being available for teamwork, which often means being available to answer chat messages, emails, phone calls or someone calling to your desk at the whim of the caller.

Personal productivity schemes like [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) can provide some tools to help us deal with the endless onslaught of demands on our time, but they don't do anything to reduce the demands or to reduce the workplace chaos. What is needed is a way of solving the organisational chaos to reduce the demands on individuals, thereby allowing them to focus on providing value. I don't have the magical answer to solving the organisation chaos, but here are some tips to help align the team on guidelines to reduce interruptions.

**Raise awareness of the impact of interruptions.** At the next team meeting, start a discussion about the impact of interruptions and their negative impact on productivity. Introduce the team to the concepts from [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/). You may be surprised to find that the themes resonate with most of the team.

**Agree on an Interruption code of practice.** Let's be honest, while some interruptions really are urgent and important, most are less time sensitive. As part of an open team discussion, come to an agreement on guidelines for interrupting others. Perhaps it is setting the expectation that people don't have to reply to chats or emails immediately or that there are blocks of time during the day when the team focuses on productive tasks and these time blocks should be protected from interruption.

**Do not disturb mode.** At an individual level, make it clear to others when you are available to collaborate and when you don't want to be interrupted. When focused on productive work, disable notifications or even close the chat application, don't read new emails and set your online status to _do not disturb_.

Managing a chaotic workplace to reduce interruptions during periods of focused high value work requires solutions at a team level. Open discussions and establishing some common ways of working can help to normalise team behaviour, reduce interruptions and improve productivity.
