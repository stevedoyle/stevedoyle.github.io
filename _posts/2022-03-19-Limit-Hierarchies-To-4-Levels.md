Title: "Limit Hierarchies To 4 Levels"

The [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) approach to organising digital information recommends a max depth of 4 levels in any data hierarchy. I've always found that the more levels and categories that exist, the greater the friction when it comes to deciding where to store a piece of information. Without clear boundaries between each category or level, finding the _right_ place to store something becomes an increasing challenge. One way to help keep [Hard Edges](https://slog.ie/hard-edges/) between categories or levels is to minimise the number of categories or levels used. This approach is echoed by some advocates of [PKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) approaches which encourage storing everything in a single flat hierarchy and then using [Maps of Contents](https://www.ideasnotebook.com/Map+of+Content) or indexes to navigate the content.

My own experiences echo this. After working on many projects which had an endless hierarchy of nested folders, finding where I stored a file or where to put a file became error prone and time consuming. Taking the time to collapse this hierarchy for a project, helped to simplify the storing of material and actually reduced the stress in navigating the directory structure.

This problem of increased [Friction](https://slog.ie/friction/) with an increasing level depth was also evident when using [[Mindmaps]]. Mindmaps are fantastic ways of capturing, organising, digesting and navigating information and for non-linear thinking but I have always found that their usability rapidly decreases when either too much detailed information is stored or if the number of levels becomes too deep. I think limiting the depth to a max of four levels and moving detailed information to atomic notes would help to ensure that mindmaps retain their usefulness. Using mindmaps in this way makes a mature map become a form of [Maps of Contents](https://www.ideasnotebook.com/Map+of+Content).
