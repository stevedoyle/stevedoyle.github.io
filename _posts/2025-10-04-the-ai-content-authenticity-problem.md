We need to talk about the elephant in the room: people passing off AI-generated content as their own work without any modification or attribution.

## The Problem

I've noticed a growing trend in the workplace where colleagues routinely use AI to generate opinions and technical responses and then present them as their own work without any disclosure or meaningful editing. The telltale signs are there: the overly polished prose, the distinctive AI phrasing patterns, the slight disconnection from the actual context of our work.

Here's what bothers me: **it's not that they're using AI**. It's that they're not being open about it.

## Why This Matters

**Trust erosion**: When you think someone has been passing off unmodified AI output as their own thinking, it undermines your confidence in all their work. What else isn't actually theirs?

**Quality issues**: AI is a tool, not a replacement for human judgment. Copy-pasting AI output without review means errors, hallucinations, and inappropriate tone slip through. I've seen AI-generated technical documentation contain factually incorrect information because no one bothered to verify it.

**Missed opportunity**: The real value of AI tools is as a thinking partner—helping you draft, refine, and explore ideas. When you skip the human-in-the-loop part, you're getting the worst of both worlds: generic content that lacks your expertise and perspective.

## A Better Approach

Using AI as a productivity tool is fine. Excellent, even. But do it right:

1. **Edit the output**: Make it yours. Add your expertise, fix errors, adjust the tone.
2. **Be transparent**: When appropriate, acknowledge you used AI assistance. For internal work, this shouldn't be controversial.
3. **Add value**: Your job isn't to be a human clipboard for ChatGPT. It's to apply your judgment, experience, and knowledge to produce something better than the raw AI output.

## The Bigger Picture

As AI tools become more prevalent, authenticity becomes more valuable, not less. The people who will thrive aren't those who can copy-paste the best prompts—they're the ones who can take AI output and elevate it with genuine insight and critical thinking.

If you're going to use AI in your work (and you probably should), at least have the integrity to make the content actually yours before putting your name on it.
