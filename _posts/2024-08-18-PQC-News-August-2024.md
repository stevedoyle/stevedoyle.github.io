- NIST published the final specifications for ML-KEM ([FIPS-203](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final)), ML-DSA ([FIPS-204](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final)) and SH-DSA ([FIPS-205](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final)).
- The release of the NIST standards has prompted a [roadmap discussion for liboqs](https://github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe/discussions/1892) with a v0.11.0 release planned for September and a liboqs 1.0 release near the end of 2024 or early 2025.
- [Google outlines how it is using PQC](https://security.googleblog.com/2024/08/post-quantum-cryptography-standards.html) including producing [formally verified post quantum algorithms](https://bughunters.google.com/blog/6038863069184000/formally-verified-post-quantum-algorithms)
