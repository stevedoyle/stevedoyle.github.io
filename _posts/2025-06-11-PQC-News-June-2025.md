- [OpenSSL 3.5](https://openssl-corporation.org/post/2025-04-08-openssl-35-final-release/?utm_source=atom_feed) adds support for PQC algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA and SLH-DSA). Interestingly, liboqs and the oqsprovider can no longer be used with OpenSSL 3.5. These algorithms are disabled in oqsprovider when used with OpenSSL 3.5.

- IETF side meeting notes published for [Goverment PQC Plans](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/saag/-Z3D08VanHqrEuPaY9W2Sm03WmE/)
- ETSI launches new standard for Quantum-Safe Hybrid Key Exchanges to secure future post-quantum encryption. Spec: [ETSI TS 104 015](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/104000_104099/104015/01.01.01_60/ts_104015v010101p.pdf)
- [NIST selects HQC as the 5th Algorithm for PQC](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/03/nist-selects-hqc-fifth-algorithm-post-quantum-encryption)
- NIST publishes a whitepaper on [Crypto Agility](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/cswp/39/considerations-for-achieving-cryptographic-agility/ipd#:~:text=This%20draft%20NIST%20Cybersecurity%20White,crypto%20agility%20while%20maintaining%20interoperability.)
- China launched its [Next Generation Commercial Cryptographic Algorithms Program (NGCC)](https://niccs.org.cn/en/notice/)
- NIST published [NIST IR 8547](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/ir/8547/ipd) "Transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards" that deprecates RSA & ECC in 2030 and disallows them from 2035. They followed up on the [pqc-forum](https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum) with a clarification that this guidance didn't apply to hybrid schemes.
- Cloudflare published a blog post on PQC signatures for TLS and their size impact: [Post-Quantum Key Agreement at Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/another-look-at-pq-signatures/). In summary most TLS connections carry a small amount of data and the size of PQ signatures will significantly increase the bytes transmitted per connection. Cloudflare will make PQ signatures opt-in until cryptographically relevant computers are imminent to prevent undue performance regression. Meanwhile, they will continue to pursue [larger changes](https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/#way-forward) to the WebPKI to avoid a performance compromise. Changes include [KEMTLS](https://blog.cloudflare.com/kemtls-post-quantum-tls-without-signatures/) - PQ TLS without signatures.
