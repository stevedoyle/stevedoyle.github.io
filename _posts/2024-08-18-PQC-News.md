# PQC News Log

August 2024
- NIST published the final specifications for ML-KEM ([FIPS-203](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final)), ML-DSA ([FIPS-204](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final)) and SH-DSA ([FIPS-205](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final)).
- The release of the NIST standards has prompted a [roadmap discussion for liboqs](https://github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe/discussions/1892) with a v0.11.0 release planned for September and a liboqs 1.0 release near the end of 2024 or early 2025.
- [Google outlines how it is using PQC](https://security.googleblog.com/2024/08/post-quantum-cryptography-standards.html) including producing [formally verified post quantum algorithms](https://bughunters.google.com/blog/6038863069184000/formally-verified-post-quantum-algorithms)

July 2024
- Will we get the final specifications for ML-KEM and ML-DSA this month? [White House Advisor Says NIST May Release PQC Algorithm Specifications as early as July](https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/05/24/white-house-advisor-says-nist-to-release-post-quantum-cryptographic-algorithms-in-coming-weeks/)
- [NVIDIA cuPQC](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuPQC) is now available for download. It leverages the parallel processing power of NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate post-quantum cryptographic operations.
- [Google Quantum Computing](https://quantumai.google) has released a new version of [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) that includes support for post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.
- [The Rustls TLS Library Adds PQC Key Exchange Support](https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/pq-key-exchange/). The support is currently available via a separate experimental crate, [rustls=post-quantum](https://crates.io/crates/rustls-post-quantum).
