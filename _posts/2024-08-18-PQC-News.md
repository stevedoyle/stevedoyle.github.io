# PQC News Log

## November 2024

- NIST published [NIST IR 8547](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/ir/8547/ipd) "Transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards", a report that outlines the proposed transition to PQC. It outlines a ten year timeline to migrate the world's cryptographic subsystems.
- Many of the [IETF 121](https://www.ietf.org/meeting/121/) working groups had agenda items related to PQC. It is good to see some of the [documents](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/pquip/documents/) from the Post Quantum Use In Protocols (pquip) working group getting close to publication, including [Terminology for Post-Quantum Traditional Hybrid Schemes](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology/), [Post-Quantum Cryptography for Engineers](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-pquip-pqc-engineers/) and [Hybrid Signature Spectrums](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-pquip-hybrid-signature-spectrums/).
- NIST held a public meeting to outline [plans](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/stateful-hash-based-signatures/presentations) for updates to [SP 800-208](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/208/final) "Recommendation for Stateful Hash-Based Signature Schemes" to address industry feedback on the restriction against private key export.
- Cloudflare published a blog post [looking at the latest post-quantum signature standardization candidates](https://blog.cloudflare.com/another-look-at-pq-signatures/) which included an [analysis of the impact of ML-DSA on TLS](https://blog.cloudflare.com/another-look-at-pq-signatures/#how-many-added-bytes-are-too-many-for-tls). Their analysis concluded that "For the majority of QUIC connections, using ML-DSA as a drop-in replacement for classical signatures would more than double the number of transmitted bytes over the lifetime of the connection." and again suggested an alternative path forward to use a KEM [instead of a signature](https://kemtls.org/) for handshake authentication.

## August 2024

- NIST published the final specifications for ML-KEM ([FIPS-203](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final)), ML-DSA ([FIPS-204](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final)) and SH-DSA ([FIPS-205](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final)).
- The release of the NIST standards has prompted a [roadmap discussion for liboqs](https://github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe/discussions/1892) with a v0.11.0 release planned for September and a liboqs 1.0 release near the end of 2024 or early 2025.
- [Google outlines how it is using PQC](https://security.googleblog.com/2024/08/post-quantum-cryptography-standards.html) including producing [formally verified post quantum algorithms](https://bughunters.google.com/blog/6038863069184000/formally-verified-post-quantum-algorithms)

## July 2024

- Will we get the final specifications for ML-KEM and ML-DSA this month? [White House Advisor Says NIST May Release PQC Algorithm Specifications as early as July](https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/05/24/white-house-advisor-says-nist-to-release-post-quantum-cryptographic-algorithms-in-coming-weeks/)
- [NVIDIA cuPQC](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuPQC) is now available for download. It leverages the parallel processing power of NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate post-quantum cryptographic operations.
- [Google Quantum Computing](https://quantumai.google) has released a new version of [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) that includes support for post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.
- [The Rustls TLS Library Adds PQC Key Exchange Support](https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/pq-key-exchange/). The support is currently available via a separate experimental crate, [rustls=post-quantum](https://crates.io/crates/rustls-post-quantum).
