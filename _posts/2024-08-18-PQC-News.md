# PQC News Log

## August 2024

- NIST published the final specifications for ML-KEM ([FIPS-203](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final)), ML-DSA ([FIPS-204](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final)) and SH-DSA ([FIPS-205](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final)).

## July 2024

- Will we get the final specifications for ML-KEM and ML-DSA this month? [White House Advisor Says NIST May Release PQC Algorithm Specifications as early as July](https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/05/24/white-house-advisor-says-nist-to-release-post-quantum-cryptographic-algorithms-in-coming-weeks/)
- [NVIDIA cuPQC](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuPQC) is now available for download. It leverages the parallel processing power of NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate post-quantum cryptographic operations.
- [Google Quantum Computing](https://quantumai.google) has released a new version of [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) that includes support for post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.
- [The Rustls TLS Library Adds PQC Key Exchange Support](https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/pq-key-exchange/). The support is currently available via a separate experimental crate, [rustls=post-quantum](https://crates.io/crates/rustls-post-quantum).
