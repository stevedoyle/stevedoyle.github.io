[Cal Newport](https://calnewport.com/) describes the use of time block planning and [The Importance of Planning Every Minute of Your Work Day](https://calnewport.com/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/). This is very similar to the zero based budgeting method used by [YNAB](https://ynab.com/), where every dollar is given a job. Exploring this further, can all of YNAB's [four rules](https://www.ynab.com/the-four-rules/) be applied to time block planning?

**Rule 1**: Give Every ~~Dollar~~ Minute a Job, aka Plan Every Minute of Your Work Day. Time is the currency of planning your working day.

**Rule 2**: Embrace ~~Your True Expenses~~ Deep Work. True expenses in zero based budgeting terms are the expenses that don't occur every month but nonetheless need to be budgeted for. In getting the most out of our time and getting things done, [deep work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692) is the vastly important work that we need to set aside time to focus on. Without planning time for deep work, it is likely that our working time becomes consumed with less important work such as checking email etc. or that our time is used inefficiently requiring us to work longer hours to get our work done.

**Rule 3**: Roll With The Punches. Just like in budgeting, our work days are often unpredictable and our best laid plans are likely to change due to an urgent item that needs attention, a meeting overrun, a cancelled meeting, etc. When this happens, adapt the time block plan around this. Pushed items can be rescheduled for another day. The important thing is to consciously replan and actively decide where your time is best spent for the remainder of the day.

**Rule 4:** Age Your ~~Money~~ Time. The budgeting name of this rule doesn’t really apply to time blocking but the concept does. With time blocking the currency is time and the primary aim of time blocking is to use work time more efficiently. So over time, the benefit of time blocking should result in an increase in time efficiency which could translate into either more time available for non-work stuff or being able to get more work done in the same amount of time.
